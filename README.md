# TE_annotations-RepeatMasker-
Collection of TransposableElement Annotations

Annotation of transposable elements was done by running RepeatMasker 4.1.2-p1 (Smith et al. 2013) with rmblastn 2.11.0+ using combined databases Dfam3.2 (2020-07-02) & RepBase-20181026 (Bao et al. 2015; Storer et al. 2021). The query sequence was set to Arabidopsis. The resulting out file was used to merge annotation units of the same repeat family at a maximum distance of 250 bp to finalize repetitive element annotation.
